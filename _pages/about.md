I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University with Professor [Yuanyuan Yang](https://www.ece.stonybrook.edu/~yang/). I received the B.Eng. degree in computer science and technology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2017, where I was a member of the [ACM Honored Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home). My research interests include algorithms and systems for blockchain, edge computing, and quantum networking. 

I am on the academic/industrial job market this year (2025-26). Please don't hesitate to contact me with any opportunities!
