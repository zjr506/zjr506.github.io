Stony Brook University ACM-ICPC Team
======
One of the creators of [SBU Compprog](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~compprog/).

As the best result in SBU history, the 2020 team ranked 3rd in the [2020 Greater New York Regional](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~compprog/pages/20210413.html), and the 2023 team ranked 19th in the [2023 North American Championship](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~compprog/pages/nacRes2023.html). 

I was ranked 4th in the [2018 Greater New York Regional](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~rezaul/ACM-ICPC/GNY-2018/regional-2018.html). Really close to World Final.
